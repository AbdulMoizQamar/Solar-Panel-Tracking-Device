# Solar-Panel-Tracking-Device
This project aims to create an efficient solar panel tracking system that optimizes energy generation by adjusting the panel’s orientation based on the sun’s position. Using light sensors and servo motors, the device ensures that solar panels always face the sun, maximizing energy output.
